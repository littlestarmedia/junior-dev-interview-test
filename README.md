# Junior Developer Interview Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Junior Developer Interview Test. This test is designed to assess your 
ability to write code, use dependency management tools and your ability to use version control 
systems. In this repository are a series of unit tests which you must make pass by writing
the necessary code. 

## Objectives
This test is not engineered to catch you out, stump you or make you feel inadequate. 
The goal is to observe how you can follow instructions, communicate effectively, 
ask questions when necessary and demonstrate your ability to learn. We want to see 
your approach to problem-solving, how you adapt to new challenges and your 
willingness to engage with the team.
